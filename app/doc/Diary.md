Super Idea
1. submit zip file to chat gpt and then let it generate all code
2. generate all prompt and let gpt do all of them togather

zip ideas
1. security 
2. use sepearate table for each user or db which they can host themselve and the plateform is just the frontend.
3. the chat , profiles and task and connect are all act in a separate div and also callable within layout. now ecah of them can be be a separate html like chat.html with only div and when they want to be called from dashboard only div page will be included and whenever they will be called indeoendent then there will be one frame page for all such pages. like frame.html which will have call to layout.html
4. generate an Admin page and that will be visibile only when admin flag is on for a user or even hard coded.
5. for profiles, add ability to send profiles and track

future
6. build a chess analysis engine
7. people can play chess togather
8. jigauanshu to do testing
9. ajith to do testing - computer training (setup a pc for computer training for pushpa and ajith) - eventually leading to computer trainign institute
10. automatic testing
